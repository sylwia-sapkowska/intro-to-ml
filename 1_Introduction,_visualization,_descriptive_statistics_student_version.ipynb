If needed, adjust the parameters of the `pd.read_csv()` function. The most commonly adjusted parameters are `sep`, `header` and `dtype`. Display the last rows by calling `df.tail()` and check if you can already spot some features of the data set, e.g., whether it is sorted with respect to some column. Check if there are null values.\n",

Otherwise, new files would be created with subsequent numbers appended to the filename. Also, note that for `!curl` you can achieve this with only `-O`, but it does not follow HTTP redirects by default and you need to force it to do so with `-L`."

For mode use [df.mode()](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.mode.html). Run it for all columns, but note that for each one there can be multiple modes.
