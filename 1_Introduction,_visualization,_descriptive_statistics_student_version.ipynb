Inside the box, a horizontal line shows the median. Outside of the box, whiskers show the typical range of observations. They either reach the maximum or minimum value in the column or, if those values are far away from the median, their length is equal to 1.5 times the interquartile range, i.e. 1.5 times the height of the box. For a normal distribution, this corresponds to 99% of the observations. Points are used to show observations that are not within the whiskers.  "
